                <h3>Managing Cramps</h3>
                <p>Menstrual cramps can be uncomfortable, but here are some tips to help manage them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Heat Therapy:</strong> Apply a heating pad or hot water bottle to your lower abdomen. Heat helps relax the muscles and relieve cramping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Light exercises like walking or yoga can increase blood flow and reduce cramps. Activities that release endorphins, such as stretching or gentle yoga, can also help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water to prevent bloating and reduce cramps. Herbal teas, especially those with anti-inflammatory properties like chamomile, can also be beneficial.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Reduce intake of salty, fatty, and sugary foods, which can exacerbate bloating and discomfort. Instead, focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Over-the-Counter Medication:</strong> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can help reduce inflammation and pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relaxation Techniques:</strong> Practice deep breathing, meditation, or other relaxation techniques to help manage stress, which can sometimes increase the perception of pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Massage:</strong> Gently massaging your lower abdomen can help reduce muscle tension and alleviate cramps.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Healthy Eating</h3>
                <p>Eating a healthy diet can help manage menstrual symptoms and improve overall well-being. Here are some dietary tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Iron-Rich Foods:</strong> Menstruation can lead to iron loss, so it's important to include iron-rich foods such as lean meats, beans, lentils, spinach, and fortified cereals in your diet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Calcium and Vitamin D:</strong> These nutrients can help alleviate PMS symptoms. Include dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified foods in your diet. Sun exposure can also help your body produce vitamin D.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium can help reduce bloating and improve mood. Foods high in magnesium include nuts, seeds, whole grains, and dark chocolate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids:</strong> These can reduce inflammation and are found in fatty fish (like salmon), flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drinking enough water is crucial for preventing bloating and maintaining overall health. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Herbal Teas:</strong> Teas like ginger, peppermint, and chamomile can soothe menstrual cramps and reduce stress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:</strong> Both can increase bloating and mood swings. Try to minimize your intake, especially around your period.</li>
                </ul>
